# Smart Product Design Course

Welcome to the **Smart Product Design Course** repository! This repository serves as a centralized hub for course materials, code, and resources to help you master the art of designing and building IoT-enabled smart products.

---

## Course Overview
The Smart Product Design course focuses on combining **hardware programming**, **IoT principles**, and **prototyping techniques** to create innovative smart products. By the end of the course, you will have hands-on experience in:
- Programming and interfacing with **ESP32**.
- Using **sensors** and **actuators** for real-world applications.
- Connecting devices to **cloud platforms** for data monitoring and control.
- Designing and prototyping a **final smart product**.

## Repository Structure
This repository is organized to align with the weekly lecture plan:
- `Lecture01/`: Introduction to IoT and ESP32 Basics.
- `Lecture02/`: Sensor Interfacing and Data Collection.
- `Lecture03/`: Actuator Control and Real-Time Applications.
- ... *(more lectures will be added progressively)*.
- `FinalProject/`: Resources for your final smart product project.

Each folder contains:
- **Code examples** for practical tasks.
- **Assignment details** for hands-on exercises.
- Relevant **documentation** and resources.
