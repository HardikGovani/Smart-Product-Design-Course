# Practicals

This repository contains beginner-friendly exercises to get hands-on experience with Kits Components. Each exercise involves interfacing a sensor or component with a esp32 to achieve specific functionality. Below is a list of exercises with a brief description of each.

## Exercises

### 1. LED Blinking (with Random Delay)
- A simple program to make an LED blink with a randomly generated delay between each blink.

### 2. Push Button + LED
- Control an LED using a push button. The LED turns on when the button is pressed and turns off when released.

### 3. LDR Sensor + LED
- Use an LDR sensor to control an LED. The LED lights up in response to changes in ambient light levels.

### 4. Push Button + Buzzer
- Trigger a buzzer with the press of a button.

### 5. IR Sensor + Buzzer
- Detect objects using an IR sensor and sound a buzzer when an object is detected.

### 6. Sound Microphone Sensor + LED
- Use a microphone sound sensor to control an LED, lighting it up based on sound levels.

### 7. Flame / Fire Sensor + Buzzer
- Detect the presence of flame or fire with a sensor and sound a buzzer as an alert.

### 8. MQ135 / Air Quality Sensor + Buzzer
- Monitor air quality with the MQ135 sensor and trigger a buzzer if harmful gas levels are detected.

### 9. Soil Moisture Sensor + DC Motor
- Automate watering by controlling a DC motor based on soil moisture levels.

### 10. Soil Moisture Sensor + Relay
- Control high-power devices like water pumps using a relay triggered by soil moisture readings.

### 11. Ultrasonic Sensor + OLED Display
- Measure distance with an ultrasonic sensor and display the results on an OLED screen.

### 12. Ultrasonic Sensor + Servo Motor
- Use an ultrasonic sensor to control the angle of a servo motor, creating a distance-based motion system.

### 13. BMP280 + OLED Display
- Measure temperature and pressure with the BMP280 sensor and display the data on an OLED screen.

### 14. MPU6050 + OLED Display
- Use the MPU6050 sensor to measure acceleration and gyroscopic data, displaying it on an OLED screen.

### 15. MPU6050 + WS2812
- Combine the MPU6050 sensor with WS2812 LEDs to create motion-based LED effects.

### 16. WiFi / Webserver Based LED & Buzzer Control
- Create a web server to control an LED and buzzer over WiFi.
